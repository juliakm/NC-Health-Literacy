#### Reduce Stress: Understanding the Mind-Body Connection

Each year, 1 in 5 American adults and children experience a diagnosable mental health condition. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, and help is available. Researchers have found many links between certain emotions and physical ailments, especially heart disease. Consider:

  * A number of emotional and social factors contribute to heart disease.  These include depression, isolation, poverty, stress, and emotional strains.
  * Patients who describe themselves as highly optimistic had a lower risk of early death, including cardiovascular death, than their highly pessimistic counterparts.
  * A positive outlook also seems to help the body ward off less serious diseases, including the common cold.
  * Stress or a change of mood affects the production of certain enzymes that play a role in wound healing.  
  * There is direct link between chronic stress and premature aging of cells.

Your mood matters to your mental health and physical health! Don’t brush off chronic sadness, depression, stress and anxiety. Respond to stress in healthy ways, such as exercise and setting aside time every day for YOU to relax, recharge and reflect on the positive elements of day.

If these coping strategies don’t lift your mood, seek help. Mental health conditions are not a sign of weakness. Underlying conditions can often be resolved or managed with help from a counselor, medical provider, or other mental health professional. So don’t delay seeking help!


#### Action Steps
*Enlist the help of others.* Ask for help when you need it. Often times, our co-workers, friends, and family would be happy to jump in and lighten our loads—we just have to ask.

*Reward yourself.* Every day comes with its own challenges and lists of tasks. Don’t let yourself roll from one completed task to the next without patting yourself on the back. Take a moment to congratulate yourself for even the smallest accomplishments.  And for bigger accomplishments, reward yourself with something special like a good magazine or a movie with a friend. When you reward yourself, make sure that the rewarding behavior is also healthy. For example, it would be better to have going to a movie be a reward for exercising than eating a chocolate bar.

*De-stress on the spot.* When you are in the middle of a stressful experience but cannot escape, stand tall and take three deep breaths. This helps you think clearly and leaves you feeling strong and energized. Practice taking three deep breaths every hour on the hour so you will do it naturally when faced with stress.
