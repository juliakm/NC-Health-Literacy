#### Take Control of Your Health by Knowing Your Numbers

It's always a good time to take stock of your health. The easiest way to do that is through a health assessment with your Primary Care Provider (PCP).

In a health assessment, your PCP will measure your height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol (HDL, LDL, triglycerides), and glucose (or A1C for diabetics).

Talking with your PCP and understanding your screening results puts YOU in charge of your health.  Your screening results give you insight on how your body is reacting to the daily choices you make.  While these screening results do not tell the whole story, they are vital in helping you create a successful health plan.

You can also track your own health indicators as you make progress toward your goals. A great way to stay motivated while losing weight is to track your weight over time. Similarly, you can use a pedometer or FitBit to track your steps over time as you become more active.

#### Action Steps

*Schedule it.* Talk with your PCP about what routine screenings you should have and how often.  If you do not have a PCP, you can search for one using the Provider Search Tool, or by visiting [shpnc.org](shpnc.org) and clicking on “Find a Doctor.”

*Track health indicators.* Using an online tool, spreadsheet or notebook, track your weight over time. Studies show that being more aware of your weight can lead to healthier eating choices over time.

*Count your steps.* Using a FitBit or other step-tracking device, you can see how many steps you take a day. Set the goal of increasing your steps by 10 percent each week and soon you will be walking more than ever!
