#### Move Every Day!

#### Action Steps

*Connect with family and friends.* Turn your evening exercise into a walk with your spouse, invite friends over for a potluck-style dinner, or schedule a getaway with your family— quality time with loved ones helps keep us energized.

*Schedule it.* If we prioritized going to the gym like we prioritized meetings at work, we might all be healthier. Too often, healthy habits are viewed as optional, but you are a priority! Putting things on your calendar will help you keep health at the top of your to-do list.  For example, schedule time to meditate every day for 5-10 minutes at 7 a.m. and commit to keeping that appointment.
