#### Move Every Day

Exercise can help you control your weight, combat heart disease and other health conditions, and boost your mood and energy levels. Only one in three adults gets the recommended amount of exercise – 30 minutes of physical activity each day. But where will you find the time and energy? Easy. Find something convenient and fun that just gets you moving.

Walk, dance, play, work in your yard – 30 minutes a day can help you stay in shape and feeling good. Physical activity is essential for all of us. Children, adults and seniors can benefit from moderate activity every day. Take a walk with a friend, take the stairs instead of the elevator, use the parking lot farthest away from the store, or even work in your yard. Dancing works, too!

Thirty minutes or more of motion for adults and 60 minutes for children on most days can help keep you in shape and feeling good. Can’t find a 30 minute chunk of time? Break it up throughout the day. For more ideas on how to get started, see below. For now – leave the computer screen for a few minutes and move.

#### Action Steps

*Get a checkup.* Before beginning any workout program, get an appointment with your doctor. A checkup, if you haven’t had one recently, will give you a good idea of where you stand and what you need to work on. A doctor’s advice and a clean bill of health also clear the mind and help you focus on the task before you.

*Connect with family and friends.* Turn your evening exercise into a walk with your spouse, invite friends over for a potluck-style dinner, or schedule a getaway with your family— quality time with loved ones helps keep us energized.

*Schedule it.* If we prioritized going to the gym like we prioritized meetings at work, we might all be healthier. Too often, healthy habits are viewed as optional, but you are a priority! Putting things on your calendar will help you keep health at the top of your to-do list.  For example, schedule time to meditate every day for 5-10 minutes at 7 a.m. and commit to keeping that appointment.
