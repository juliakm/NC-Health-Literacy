#### Give up smoking

Every new season brings a commitment to change, a need to improve and make this year better than the last.  Can you imagine yourself tobacco free this year? If you’re serious about quitting, keep “START” in mind to get ready to quit:

*S* – Set a quit date. Pick a date within two weeks so you don’t lose momentum. Write the date down in your calendar to make it official.

*T* – Tell friends, family and co-workers about your plans to quit. Ask for their help by not smoking around you or keeping you busy when a craving hits.

*A* – Anticipate and plan for the challenges you will face while quitting. The first three months are the hardest. Plan how you will handle withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and smoking triggers and cues.

*R* – Remove cigarettes and other tobacco products from your home, car and work. Also, get rid of things that remind you of smoking, such as ashtrays and lighters.

*T* – Talk to your doctor about getting help to quit. Your doctor can help you choose a smoking cessation medication, nicotine replacement therapy, find a counselor, or refer you to QuitlineNC.
