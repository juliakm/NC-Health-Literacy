#### Give up smoking

Every new season brings a commitment to change, a need to improve and make this year better than the last.  Can you imagine yourself tobacco free this year? If you’re serious about quitting, it's time to get started.

#### Action Steps

*Set a quit date.* Pick a date within two weeks so you don’t lose momentum. Write the date down in your calendar to make it official.

*Build a cheerleading team.* Tell friends, family and co-workers about your plans to quit. Ask for their help by not smoking around you or keeping you busy when a craving hits.

*Anticipate and plan.*  The first three months are the hardest. Plan how you will handle withdrawal symptoms, cravings, and smoking triggers and cues.

*Say goodybye.* Remove cigarettes and other tobacco products from your home, car and work. Also, get rid of things that remind you of smoking, such as ashtrays and lighters.

*Talk to your doctor.* Talk to your doctor about getting help to quit. Your doctor can help you choose a smoking cessation medication, nicotine replacement therapy, find a counselor, or refer you to QuitlineNC.
