#### Take Control of Your Health by Knowing Your Numbers

It's always a good time to take stock of your health. A great way to do that is through a health assessment with your Primary Care Provider (PCP) or an independent laboratory.

In a health assessment, your PCP will measure your height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol (HDL, LDL, triglycerides), and glucose (or A1C for diabetics).

Talking with your PCP and understanding your screening results puts YOU in charge of your health.  Your screening results give you insight on how your body is reacting to the daily choices you make.  While these screening results do not tell the whole story, they are vital in helping you create a successful health plan.

#### Action Steps

*Schedule It.* Talk with your PCP about what routine screenings you should have and how often.  If you do not have a PCP, you can search for one using the Provider Search Tool, or by visiting shpnc.org and clicking on “Find a Doctor.”
