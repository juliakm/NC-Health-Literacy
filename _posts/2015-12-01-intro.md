The specific focus will be Health Intelligence (HI), with five items to focus on, like diet, weight, quitting smoking, stress, or another topic or topics to be determined. The aim is to provide a simple and engaging format where people can act on their own to pick one item at a time as an achievable goal to work on. The concept, subject to fine-tuning, is: "Hit your HI 5 this year â€“ pick one and own it to make a lifestyle difference." Other possible topics include how to talk to your doctor, how to get the most from your health benefits and how to save on health costs.

Our goal is that an average state employee, in many cases a woman ranging in age from the late 30s to the early 50s, will see the website as a tool to help her enact behavioral change. Information on the site will be highly readable and follow-up steps to take action will be easy to understand. Since typical barriers to healthy changes include having realistic goals, confidence, and time commitment, the site will focus on small steps members like the average employee can take to make healthy progress against small, manageable goals.
